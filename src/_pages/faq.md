Who's organising ScriptConf?
: ScriptConf organised by [Sebastian Gierlinger](https://twitter.com/sebgie) and [Stefan Baumgartner](https://twitter.com/ddprrt).

Both have been frequent visitors and speakers at conferences all over the world and let their experiences flow into the organisation of ScriptConf.
What is the language of the talks?

: With your purchase for the main event you get an all-inclusive ticket to the conference, including the show, food, coffee, refreshments and of course the drinks at the after-show party.
: With your purchase for the workshop ticket you get coffee, refreshments and lunch. All next to an 8 hour course with our workshop host, of course.
Are student tickets available?
: Yes, we have a few student tickets available which are 66% of the original price. Send us an e-Mail to office (at) scriptconf.org and we give you all the necessary details.
Are tickets refundable/reassignable?
: You can reassign tickets up until the conference itself. Let us know if it's in the range of 7 days before the event, as we can't change the badge anymore. Tickets are not refundable, unless we cancel the event, then you get the full refund.
Are you interested in our conference app?
