      - "We often reach for existing libraries when dealing with advanced app features such as routing, state management, form validation and i18n, and a lot of times the implementations behind these libraries can be a black box."
      - "In this workshop we are going to build simple versions of such libraries from the ground up using basic Vue features."
      - "This will help you better understand the nature of these problems and how to better leverage Vueâ€™s reactivity system to come up with elegant solutions."

    title: "Radically Accessible Internet Applications ðŸ’¯"
    abstract:
      - "An accessible internet experience makes all the difference for a person with a disability, whether they're enjoying online entertainment, paying bills or booking a trip to go adaptive skiing. You see, people with disabilities gain privacy and independence when they can handle their own affairs. Wouldn't it be radical if every web application supported users with disabilities?"
      - "As JavaScript experts, we can enable more of our users by shipping accessible interfaces every time, and I'll show you how. In this talk, we'll audit a client-rendered web application for accessibility, making the necessary changes to support people with disabilities. The best part about it? By integrating accessibility into our development workflow, we'll make our apps more usable by everyone."

    title: "Next wave infrastructure - do far more with much less"
    abstract:
      - "Recent years have seen a shift in technical architectures. Building complex services for the web used to be just that â€“ complex. Projects might have demanded a broad range of specialist skills which could stretch even the fullest of full-stack developers. These days we have a growing number of options for how we design, build and maintain the systems which keep our web sites and applications alive."
      - "This talk will look at ways to make use of emerging tools and services which can deliver surprisingly rich features and capabilities without maintaining expensive and complex infrastructure. Weâ€™ll talk about the benefits in keeping your stack simple, in using the expertise of others, and we'll examine the performance and security benefits of JAMstack and microservices."
