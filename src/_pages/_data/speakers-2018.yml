    title: "The Journey to Full Time Open Source"
    abstract:
      - "Working on open source has changed my life. I am self-employed and work on open source full-time. I don't have a boss. I only work on projects that I enjoy working on, and I can work whenever and wherever I want. I also let people use all the code I write for free. This is all made possible thanks to the amazing support from the community made up of the users of my open source projects."
      - "I think I'm incredibly lucky to be in this position today. Yet there are still many open source maintainers struggling on the verge of burnout while their software is being used by millions. So in this talk I will share with you my journey of open source - in particular how I made it my full-time job - in the hope of shedding some insights on open source sustainability."

    abstract:
      - "We often reach for existing libraries when dealing with advanced app features such as routing, state management, form validation and i18n, and a lot of times the implementations behind these libraries can be a black box."
      - "In this workshop we are going to build simple versions of such libraries from the ground up using basic Vue features."
      - "This will help you better understand the nature of these problems and how to better leverage Vueâ€™s reactivity system to come up with elegant solutions."

  - "Evan is a developer, designer and creative coder. He is the author of Vue.js, a JavaScript framework for building modern web interfaces with reactive components."
  - "In the past Evan worked at Meteor Development Group on the most starred full-stack JavaScript framework on GitHub, and before that spent two years at Google Creative Lab hacking on experimental UI prototypes for various Google products."

    title: "Radically Accessible Internet Applications ðŸ’¯"
    abstract:
      - "An accessible internet experience makes all the difference for a person with a disability, whether they're enjoying online entertainment, paying bills or booking a trip to go adaptive skiing. You see, people with disabilities gain privacy and independence when they can handle their own affairs. Wouldn't it be radical if every web application supported users with disabilities?"
      - "As JavaScript experts, we can enable more of our users by shipping accessible interfaces every time, and I'll show you how. In this talk, we'll audit a client-rendered web application for accessibility, making the necessary changes to support people with disabilities. The best part about it? By integrating accessibility into our development workflow, we'll make our apps more usable by everyone."

  talk:
    title: "Hop on the serverless adventure with NodeJS"
    abstract: "Serverless is the new black - I can deploy my application to the cloud without ever worrying about infrastructure. We all remember the days when we had to spend hours and hours configuring and debugging web servers when all we wanted was to just code and test our app. Those days are long gone and itâ€™s time for us to unlearn how to provision and manage infrastructure while focusing on building and scaling applications."

    title: "Next wave infrastructure - do far more with much less"
    abstract:
      - "Recent years have seen a shift in technical architectures. Building complex services for the web used to be just that â€“ complex. Projects might have demanded a broad range of specialist skills which could stretch even the fullest of full-stack developers. These days we have a growing number of options for how we design, build and maintain the systems which keep our web sites and applications alive."
      - "This talk will look at ways to make use of emerging tools and services which can deliver surprisingly rich features and capabilities without maintaining expensive and complex infrastructure. Weâ€™ll talk about the benefits in keeping your stack simple, in using the expertise of others, and we'll examine the performance and security benefits of JAMstack and microservices."

    title: "Look mum, no hands!"
    abstract:
      - "A typical interaction with a device or interface involves touching it. Either you're pressing buttons on a controller, swiping on a touchscreen or clicking on your laptop's trackpad. But what if you could control things without the use of your hands? What if you could use... your thoughts?"
      - "I have been tinkering with a brain sensor and developed an open source JavaScript framework for it to allow me (or anyone else) to control interfaces or robots using facial expressions and mental commands."

   - "Charlie Gerard is a software developer by day and a maker of things by night. She spends her personal time tinkering with hardware and experimenting with creative technologies."
   - "When she's not prototyping projects mixing art and technology, she likes to mentor young developers and contribute to open-source."
