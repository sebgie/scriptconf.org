## January 18: RxJS Deep Dive Workshop with Andre Staltz

RxJS Observables are present in frontend frameworks like Angular and
Cycle.js, and are useful in diverse contexts, from backend to frontend
and also mobile apps. They are meant for organizing asynchronous code,
but often look challenging to beginners.

Come learn the fundamental concepts behind RxJS and gain confidence
programming with reactive Observables. In this workshop, Andre
Staltz will guide you through lectures and exercises. Expect to see RxJS
concepts demystified, practice with exercises, make questions, and gain
confidence with the tools.
