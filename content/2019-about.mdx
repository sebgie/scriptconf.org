script'19 is the *JavaScript conference for everyone*. We roam on the edges of the ecosystem
to see what lies beyond our day to day work. To become better developers and better humans.

We are *independent*, *community-driven*, *affordable* and *inclusive*.

You can get *[tickets here](https://ti.to/scriptconf/scriptconf-2019)*.
