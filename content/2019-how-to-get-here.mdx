### Traveling to Linz

Linz is in the heart of Austria, and very good reachable by car, train and plane.

### Linz by car

*Coming from Vienna/Salzburg/Munich*: Take the A1 to Linz, at the highway knot Linz take
the A7. Take the exit Zentrum, it's closest to the venue. See this [map](http://www.linz.at/verkehr/34298.asp)
for parking garages in the inner city of Linz (~20 EUR per day). You can also park at the [main
station of Linz](http://www.parken.cc/) (~13 EUR per day). There are also a few [free parking areas](https://portal.linz.gv.at/Serviceguide/viewChapter.html?chapterid=122194).

### Linz by train

Linz has great train connections from all over Europe along the Westbahn route. You can travel with both
[Westbahn](http://westbahn.at) and [ÖBB](http://oebb.at) to the main station of Linz, which
is just a 10 minute walk or a 5 minute tram ride away from the venue. We timed the conference so that you
can easily arrive on the day of the conference, and reach all the important connections after the show.

### Linz by plane

Linz has a small airport (LNZ) which is connected to Düsseldorf (DUS), Frankfurt (FRA) and London Stansted (STN). There's
a bus ([OÖVV 601](http://www.ooevv.at/upload/content/media/Fahrplanbilder_601_13.12.2015.pdf)) going every hour from
the airport to the main station.

Often, there are cheaper flights to Vienna. There's a train connection going directly from the Vienna International airport (VIE) to the Linz main station every 30 minutes, for a one and a half hour ride. You might want to take this one instead.

## Getting to the venue

Script'17 takes place at the [Central in Linz](http://www.centrallinz.at). The Central was one of the first
cinemas and has a long history in town. It's directly in the center of Linz, at the Landstraße, and reachable by tram and bus.
Search for [tram station Mozartstraße or Taubenmarkt](http://linzag.at). It's just a few meters from there (in between the interio and Orsay shops).
