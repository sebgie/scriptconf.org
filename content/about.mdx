## About ScriptConf

Script is an independent one-day, curated and handcrafted JavaScript event for the community, happening in Linz, Austria. Join us on October 25th, 2019 for a day (and night) of fun, inspiration and education.

ScriptConf started in 2016, as an effort to bring high quality conferences for the community to Linz, Austria.
After the first edition in 2017, and a whooping second edition in 2018, the organisers decided to have a little break.
2019 started with workshop tour with Vitaly Friedman from Smashing Magazine. It went well, and we got in the mood again 
to do a full blown conference!

### An excellent line-up

All our speakers come by invitation only. We carefully curate a program that will not only fit the Zeitgeist, but also give you ideas and inspiration beyond your daily work. You will get household names as well as newcomers who deserve a big stage!


### A conference for everybody

We do our best to ensure everyone is welcome — and our wonderful attendees and speakers add their fair share to make the atmosphere of Script so friendly and unique. We got this family-vibe going on, and you can be part of it!

Script lives by the JSConf code of conduct to make sure the event is welcoming and safe for everyone. We keep ticket prices as low as possible and affordable. Since we are a bunch of individuals and completely independent, all income from Script runs directly into the conference again — and you are going to feel that!

### 100% independent

There is no huge company behind ScriptConf. It's organised by a couple inviduals who want to have the best conference experience for the community. We work closly with our partners on the event's surroundings to make sure this won't be another hiring competition, but an event worthwhile for everyone involved!
