## Jo will talk on: Tweet My Wedding Dress

Inspired by a love of rainbows and silly tech projects, I decided to make my own first wearable tech - a wedding dress full of lights that could be controlled by tweets from my friends and family!
This talk will go over the tech I used (suitable for absolute beginners), the mistakes I made and the lessons I learnt. From using the Twitter API, writing my own API, coding for an Arduino and wiring the whole thing up to the worst bit - THE SEWING. I aim to share the message that it is ok to make mistakes, we all do! If you keep trying you can make something magical!
