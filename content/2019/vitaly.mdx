Vitaly loves beautiful content and does not give up easily. Born in Minsk, Belarus, he studied computer science and mathematics in Germany until he discovered a passion for typography, writing and design. After working as a freelance designer and developer for 6 years, he co-founded [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com) back in 2006, a leading online magazine for designers and developers. His curiosity drove him from interface design to front-end to performance optimization to accessibility and back to user experience over all the years.

Vitaly is the author, co-author and editor of all [Smashing books](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/). He currently works as creative lead of Smashing Magazine and front-end/UX consultant from the lovely city of Barcelona, Spain, consulting European Parliament, Haufe-Lexware, Axel-Springer and a few other companies.
