## Vitaly's workshop

On october 24th, Vitaly is doing a workshop on modern front-end techniques. You can check out details and tickets <Link href="/vitaly/workshop-front-end"><a>here</a></Link>

## Vitaly will talk on: Designing and Building With Privacy In Mind 

GDPR cookie consent prompts, push notifications, app install prompts, video autoplays and annoying pop-ups. Every time we enter a new site, it feels like a fight against all the annoying marketing messages endlessly streaming at us. If you’ve wondered why a product you looked up in a search engine one day keeps showing up in all your social channels over and over just a few hours later, that’s the power of data collection and retargeting at play. We can do better than that though.

In this session, Vitaly will be exploring privacy UX patterns, techniques, strategies and important decisions to consider when designing and building privacy-aware websites and applcations. You’ll walk away with a toolbox of applicable techniques, privacy nightmares and a few notes on how to keep your website/app GDPR-compliant and privacy-focused.
