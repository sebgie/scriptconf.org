## About Vue Vixens

Vue Vixens is an initiative that aims to create workshops to teach Vue.js in a cool and fun way to foxy people who identify as women. It is based on the successful model pioneered by ng-Girls, Rails Bridge and Django Girls initiatives. The format is a self-driven code lab completed in a workshop format in groups with mentoring by conference-goers and speakers who volunteer to help. The goal of the program is to familiarize women and those who identify as such in a supportive and inclusive location with Vue.js and general web and mobile programming concepts.

Vue Vixens is a 501(c)(3) public charity and a worldwide phenomenon, with chapters from Peru to Mauritius. Welcome to the skulk!
